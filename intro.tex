\startchapter[title=Introduction]
As the science of extracting facts from textual data has changed dramatically over the last decade and the term Natural Language Processing (NLP) took over Text Mining, the methods used have changed tremendously, too.
One of the primary drivers of this variation was the emergence of language models as a basis for plenty of packages aiming to distill valuable insights from raw text.

The use of knowledge graphs which represents an assembly of interlinked entities
helps with relation/entity extraction since they are considered as a form of semantic network used to map data collection from different sources and create connections between many concepts like real-world objects, events, situations or abstract concepts.
They are either automatically generated or “manually”.

The main focus of this work is to study the ability to extract relations between entities.
We will study some methods that answer this goal starting with the idea behind
“Language models are Open Knowledge Graphs” paper that aims to minimize the
involvement of humans in the process of constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from
pre-trained language models.
Also, we will compare their method to OpenNRE and FRED that serve the same goal.

This project is divided into four parts.
We start with Relation entity extraction/linking methods from each paper.
Next, we will provide an approach for entity and relation extraction by discussing the dataset used for every method.
We then explain the implementation of each model.
Finally, the last task would be comparing the results.
